A household grocery buying and food consumption tool.

# How it works

This is designed to be as low-overhead as possible to ensure that it's easy
for a household to use.

There are two big parts to the tool:

 * The Grocery List - items you want to go and buy
 * The Consumed Items List - items you've just finished consuming

## User flow

 1. Buy food and household items.
 2. When something is consumed, add it to the Consumed Item List.
 3. When you plan on doing groceries, review the Consumed Item List, and add
    items to the Grocery List.
 4. Take the Grocery List with you shopping.
 5. Goto 2.


# Other parts

## Recipes

In addition, the tool has evolved to contain a Recipe list as well. Recipes
allow the grouping of food items, which can be added all to the grocery list
all at once. The Web UI adds a page to list out all recipes with their
ingredients.
